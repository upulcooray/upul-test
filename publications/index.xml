Recently, a third lineage, referred to as the “Adriatic” was described within the L. viridis complex distributed from Slovenia to Greece. However, whether gene flow between the Adriatic lineage and L. viridis or L.</description></item><item><title>Network medicine framework for identifying drug-repurposing opportunities for COVID-19</title><link>/publications/covid_drugs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/covid_drugs/</guid><description>Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of prioritizing approved drugs to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Here, we deployed algorithms relying on artificial intelligence, network diffusion, and network proximity to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. We experimentally screened 918 drugs, allowing us to evaluate the performance of the existing drug-repurposing methodologies, and used a consensus algorithm to increase the accuracy of the predictions.</description></item><item><title>A wealth of discovery built on the Human Genome Project — by the numbers</title><link>/publications/humangenome/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/humangenome/</guid><description>Abstract A new analysis traces the story of the draft genome’s impact on genomics since 2001, linking its effects on publications, drug approvals and understanding of disease.

Typically, complex phenotypes are investigated under varying conditions. While approaches for comparing nodes and links in two networks exist, almost no methods for the comparison of multiple networks are available and—to best of our knowledge—no comparative method allows for whole transcriptomic network analysis. However, it is the aim of many studies to compare networks of different conditions, for example, tissues, diseases, treatments, time points, or species.</description></item><item><title>Seasonal dynamics of pelagic mycoplanktonic communities: interplay of taxon abundance, temporal occurrence, and biotic interactions</title><link>/publications/fungi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/fungi/</guid><description>Abstract Marine fungi are an important component of pelagic planktonic communities. However, it is not yet clear how individual fungal taxa are integrated in marine processes of the microbial loop and food webs. Most likely, biotic interactions play a major role in shaping the fungal community structure. Thus, the aim of our work was to identify possible biotic interactions of mycoplankton with phytoplankton and zooplankton groups and among fungi, and to investigate whether there is coherence between interactions and the dynamics, abundance and temporal occurrence of individual fungal OTUs.</description></item><item><title>Construction, comparison and evolution of networks in life sciences and other disciplines</title><link>/publications/review_networks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/review_networks/</guid><description>Abstract Network approaches have become pervasive in many research fields. They allow for a more comprehensive understanding of complex relationships between entities as well as their group-level properties and dynamics. Many networks change over time, be it within seconds or millions of years, depending on the nature of the network. Our focus will be on comparative network analyses in life sciences, where deciphering temporal network changes is a core interest of molecular, ecological, neuropsychological and evolutionary biologists.</description></item><item><title>Honey bee virus causes context-dependent changes in host social behavior</title><link>/publications/bees/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/bees/</guid><description>Abstract Anthropogenic changes create evolutionarily novel environments that present opportunities for emerging diseases, potentially changing the balance between host and pathogen. Honey bees provide essential pollination services, but intensification and globalization of honey bee management has coincided with increased pathogen pressure, primarily due to a parasitic mite/virus complex. Here, we investigated how honey bee individual and group phenotypes are altered by a virus of concern, Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV).</description></item><item><title>wTO: an R package for computing weighted topological overlap and a consensus network with integrated visualization tool</title><link>/publications/wto/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/wto/</guid><description>Abstract Network analyses, such as of gene co-expression networks, metabolic networks and ecological networks have become a central approach for the systems-level study of biological data. Several software packages exist for generating and analyzing such networks, either from correlation scores or the absolute value of a transformed score called weighted topological overlap (wTO). However, since gene regulatory processes can up- or down-regulate genes, it is of great interest to explicitly consider both positive and negative correlations when constructing a gene co-expression network.</description></item><item><title>Combined Experimental and System-Level Analyses Reveal the Complex Regulatory Network of miR-124 during Human Neurogenesis</title><link>/publications/mirna124/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/mirna124/</guid><description>Abstract Non-coding RNAs regulate many biological processes including neurogenesis. The brain-enriched miR-124 has been assigned as a key player of neuronal differentiation via its complex but little understood regulation of thousands of annotated targets. To systematically chart its regulatory functions, we used CRISPR/ Cas9 gene editing to disrupt all six miR-124 alleles in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Upon neuronal induction, miR-124-deleted cells underwent neurogenesis and became functional neurons, albeit with altered morphology and neurotransmitter specification.</description></item><item><title>Measuring hand hygiene compliance rates at hospital entrances</title><link>/publications/hands/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/hands/</guid><description>Abstract Despite the importance of hand hygiene in the health care setting, there are no studies evaluating hand hygiene compliance at hospital entrances. The study was prospectively performed over a 33-week period from March 30, 2014-November 15, 2014, to evaluate hand hygiene compliance in 2 hospital reception areas. We compared electronic handwash counters with the application of radiofrequency identification (GOJO SMARTLINK) (electronic observer) that counts each activation of alcohol gel dispensers to direct observation (human observer) via remote review of video surveillance.</description></item></channel></rss>
