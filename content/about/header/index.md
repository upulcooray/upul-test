<!-- this is a subheadline -->

Currently, I'm a **Associate Research Scientist** at the [**BarabasiLab**](https://www.barabasilab.com/) \@ [Network Science Institute - Northeastern University](https://www.networkscienceinstitute.org/)) and a **Research Trainee** at [**Channing Division of Network Medicine** (Harvard Medical School / Brigham and Women's Hospital)](https://www.brighamandwomens.org/research/departments/channing-division-of-network-medicine/about). I'm mostly interested in **biomarker discovery** for complex diseases related to auto-immune response (i.e. as rheumatoid arthritis - RA - and inflammatory bowel disease - IBD), mental disorders (such as autism spectrum disorders, bipolar, schizophrenia, PTSD, etc) and senior disorder (Alzheimer and Parkinson). I'm also interested in **drug repurpusing** for those diseases, mostly using a combination of **multi-omic**, **machine learning** and **network analysis** approaches. I'm highly interested in developing methodologies and [**R packages**](/rpackages).

During COVID-19 we decided to use our skills and focus on repurpusing drug candidates for treating this disease, a [publication can be found here](https://www.pnas.org/content/118/19/e2025581118). I was also involved with the project that celebrated the [20th anniversary of the Human Genome Project](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-021-00314-6).

I had achieved my bachelor in Biotechnology at the Pontifical Catholic University (2011) and my bachelor in Statistics at the Federal University of Paraná (2012), both in Brazil. During the whole undergraduate time, I was involved in research and received 2 awards for the best undergraduate research. While working on my Bachelor, I was also employed at HSBC multibank as a Risk Analyst.

After that, I worked as a Bioinformatician at the Heart Institute of the University of São Paulo (USP), where I started working with co-expression networks, especially investigating the influence of (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) SNPs on the networks. After finishing that project I joined the Albert Einstein Hospital as a Statistician, where I was a consultant to the research department of the hospital. In October 2015 I started my PhD under the supervision of [Dr Peter Stadler](http://www.bioinf.uni-leipzig.de/), [Dr Katja Nowick](http://www.nowick-lab.info/?author=1) and [Dr Martin Middendorf](http://pacosy.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/1-1-Home.html) at the University of Leipzig, Germany.
