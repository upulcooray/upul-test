## Summary

Cognition is a group of mental processes that include attention, memory, producing and understanding of language, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision making. Basically, cognition is what sets us - humans, assuming you are one of us -  apart from other animals. 

When cognition is affected, our mental health is affected and can lead to more complex disorders such as Bipolar Disorder, Major Depression, PTSD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Schizophrenia, etc. 
How this complex network of modifications affect our symptoms and genetics can be studied through the light of complex systems.  

The projects from Mental Wealth* try to pinpoint genes and symptoms that can be later used to targeted and personalized therapy.
