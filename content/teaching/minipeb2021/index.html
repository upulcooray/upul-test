<div id="network-science-overview" class="section level2">
<h2>Network Science: Overview</h2>
<p>Network Science is broadly employed in many fields: from understanding <em>how friends bond in a party</em> to <em>how animals interact</em>; from <em>how superheroes appear in the same comic books</em> to <em>how genes can be related to a specific biological process</em>. Network analysis is especially beneficial for understanding complex systems, in all research fields. Examples of complex biological or medical systems include gene regulatory, ecological, and neuropsychology networks. In this workshop, the focus is given to applications of Network Science to the Medical Sciences.</p>
<p>Here, I will start by introducing the basic network terminologies and then explore how can we define and identify disease modules, identify disease commorbidities, and lastly, we will learn how to repurpuse drugs for diseases with known modules. For each step, I will then present some classical and some new studies.</p>
<p>It is expected some degree of familiarity with <code>R</code>, <code>ggplot2</code>, <code>tidyr</code>, and <code>igraph</code>.</p>

<h3>Why networks are important?</h3>
<p>Networks enable us to understand how <strong>interactions</strong> between entities can affect an outcome.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How gene <strong>interactions</strong> can be associated with a <strong>disease</strong> or <strong>trait</strong></p></li>
<li><p>How genes can be <strong>differentially co-expressed</strong> in a <strong>phenotype</strong></p></li>
<li><p>How <strong>drugs</strong> target different proteins and can affect drug response</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="terminology" class="section level3">
<h3>Terminology</h3>
<p>While the nature of each system, i.e. what its entities are and what kind of interactions they have, is different, there are common notations.</p>
<p>The set of interactions among a set of entities is, in general, called a graph or a network <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Newman2018" role="doc-biblioref">Newman 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-Barabasi2016" role="doc-biblioref">Barabási 2016</a>)</span>. In graph theory, each entity is called a vertex, while in network notation it is called a node <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Barabasi2016" role="doc-biblioref">Barabási 2016</a>)</span>. Accordingly, the connections between two entities are called edges or links, respectively <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Barabasi2016" role="doc-biblioref">Barabási 2016</a>)</span>. In this workshop, I will always use the network notation, unless otherwise specified. The total number of nodes in a network is often denoted as <strong>N</strong>, and the number of links in a network is denoted as <strong>L</strong>. While nodes can receive a label, links in general, are not labeled <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Barabasi2016" role="doc-biblioref">Barabási 2016</a>)</span> (although, in many cases, weights can also be perceived as a label).</p>
<p>A network can be represented mathematically as an adjacency matrix (usually denoted as <strong>A</strong>), an edge-list, or visually as a graph.</p>

<h2>Data Commonly Used in Network Medicine</h2>
<p>In Network Medicine, we are often interested in understanding <em>how genes associated to a particular disease can influence each other</em>, <em>how two diseases are similar (or different)</em>, <em>and how a drug can be used in different set-ups.</em></p>
<p>For that, it is necessary to use data sets that are able to represent those associations: <strong>Protein-Protein Interactions</strong> are used as a map of the interactions inside our cells; <strong>Gene-Disease-Associations</strong> are used for us to identify genes that were previously associated to diseases, often using a GWAS approach.</p>
<div id="PPI" class="section level3">
<h3>Protein-Protein Interaction Networks</h3>
<p>In PPI networks, the nodes represent proteins, and they are connected by a link if they physically interact with each other <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-rual2005" role="doc-biblioref">Rual et al. 2005</a>)</span>. Typically, these interactions are measured experimentally, for instance, with the Yeast-Two-Hybrid (Y2H) system <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-uetz2000" role="doc-biblioref">Uetz et al. 2000</a>)</span>, or by protein complex immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput Mass Spectrometry <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-zhang2008" role="doc-biblioref">Zhang et al. 2008</a>; <a href="#ref-koh2012" role="doc-biblioref">Koh et al. 2012</a>)</span>, or inferred computationally based on sequence similarity <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-fong2004" role="doc-biblioref">Fong, Keating, and Singh 2004</a>)</span>. PPI can be used to infer gene functions and the association of sub-networks to diseases <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Menche2015" role="doc-biblioref">Menche et al. 2015</a>)</span>. In this type of network, a highly connected protein tends to interact with proteins that are less connected, probably to prevent unwanted cross-talk of functional modules. Most of the methods in network medicine are based on PPI.</p>
<div id="measuring-ppis" class="section level4">
<h4>Measuring PPIs</h4>
<p>Protein-Protein Interactions can be measured mainly using three different techniques:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>By the creation of Protein-Protein interaction maps derived from existing scientific literature;</p></li>
<li><p>Using computational predictions of PPIs based on available orthogonal information; and</p></li>

<h4>Understanding a PPI</h4>
<p>For this workshop, we will be using for this workshop is a combination of a manually curated PPI that combines all previous data sets. The data can be <a href="https://github.com/deisygysi/learnNetSci/blob/main/inst/tutorials/PEB2021/data/PPI_Symbol_Entrez.csv">found here</a>. This PPI was previously published in <span class="citation"><a href="#ref-Gysi2020a" role="doc-biblioref">D. M. Gysi et al.</a> (<a href="#ref-Gysi2020a" role="doc-biblioref">2020</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>Before we can start any analysis using this interactome, let us first understand this data.</p>
<p>The PPI contains the EntrezID and the HGNC symbol of each gene, and some might not have a proper map. Therefore, it should be removed from further analysis. Moreover, we might have loops, and those should also be removed.</p>
<p>Let us begin by preparing our environment and calling all libraries we will need at this point.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(data.table)
require(tidyr)
require(igraph)
require(dplyr)
require(magrittr)
require(ggplot2)</code></pre>
<p>Let’s read in our data.</p>

<p>Let’s transform our edge-list into a network.</p>

<h2>Methods for Disease Module Identification and Disease Similarity</h2>
<p>In this chapter, I will introduce the main methods used in <em>Network Medicine</em>. We will start by understanding what a <em>Disease Module</em> is, how we can calculate its significance, and also understand its importance. Next, we will explore the <em>disease separation</em>, how to calculate, and make interpretations.</p>
<div id="diseasemodule" class="section level3">
<h3>Disease Module</h3>
<p>In biological networks, genes are often involved in the same topological communities are also associated with similar biological processes <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Ahn2010" role="doc-biblioref">Ahn, Bagrow, and Lehmann 2010</a>)</span>. It also reflects on <em>how diseases localized themselves in the interaction</em>; meaning that, disease modules are highly localized in specific network neighborhoods <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Menche2015" role="doc-biblioref">Menche et al. 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<div id="largest-connected-component" class="section level4">
<h4>Largest connected component</h4>
<p>The size of the <strong>largest connected component</strong> (LCC) is the <strong>number of nodes that form a connected subgraph</strong> (in our case, it is the number of proteins that are interconnected in the PPI). Many properties of this quantity allow us to understand how a particular disease interacts with the interactome. It is important to note here that this measure is highly dependent on the completeness of an interactome. If a link between a protein and its counterparts is unknown – therefore missing – we might say that that particular node is not involved in a disease module (or that the LCC is not significant).</p>

Figure 3: Disease-Module. In a schematic of a PPI, in pink, we see genes associated with a disease, forming a connected component of size 4.

<p>However, just computing this number might not be informative, and it is expected a randomness. To calculate this randomness, we often calculate the significance of the LCC by selecting proteins in the interactome with similar degrees (aka degree preserving randomization).</p>
<p>To calculate the significance of the LCC, one can calculate its Z-Score or simply calculate the empirical probability under the curve from the empirical distribution. The Z-score is given by:</p>

<h3>Gene Overlap</h3>
<p>A first intuitive way to measure the overlap of two gene sets is by calculating its overlap, or its normalized overlap, the <strong>Jaccard Index</strong>. The Jaccard index is calculated by taking the ratio of <strong>Intersection of two sets over the Union of those sets</strong>. The Jaccard coefficient measures similarity between finite sample sets, and is defined as the size of the intersection divided by the size of the union of the sample sets:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
J(A,B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A \cup B|} = \frac{|A \cap B|}{|A| + |B| - |A \cap B|}.
\]</span></p>
<p>Note that by design, <span class="math inline">\(0 \leq J(A,B) \leq 1\)</span>. If A and B are both empty, define <span class="math inline">\(J(A,B) = 1\)</span>.</p>

<h3>Disease Separation</h3>
<p>When looking into the Jaccard Index, we have a sense of how similar two diseases are based on genes that are <strong>known</strong> to be associated with both diseases. The main problem with this is that we assume that all genes associated with a disease is known, and we do not take the topology of the underlying network into account.</p>
<p>The <strong>separation</strong> is a complementary quantity that is a bit less sensitive to the incompleteness of the PPI, we can measure the distances <span class="math inline">\(d_s\)</span> of each disease-associated node to all other disease associated nodes. Taking into account only the shortest distance between them results in a distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(d_s)\)</span>. The mean value <span class="math inline">\(&lt;d_s&gt;\)</span> can be interpreted as the diameter of the disease model. <strong>Note</strong> the diameter here is the average distance instead of the maximal distance.</p>
<p>The <strong>concept of network localization</strong> can be further generalized to examine the relationship between any different sets of nodes, for example, proteins associated with two different diseases. The network serves as a <strong>map</strong>, where diseases are represented by different neighborhoods. How close and the degree of overlap of two network neighborhoods can be found to be highly predictive of the pathological similarity of those diseases <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Menche2015" role="doc-biblioref">Menche et al. 2015</a>)</span>.</p>
<p>To quantify the distance of two sets of nodes A and B, we first compute the distribution <span class="math inline">\(P(d_{AB})\)</span> of all shortest distances <span class="math inline">\(d_{AB}\)</span> between nodes A and B and the respective mean distance <span class="math inline">\(&lt;d_{AB}&gt;\)</span>.</p>
<p>The network based separation <span class="math inline">\(S_{AB}\)</span> can be obtained by comparing the mean shortest distance <strong>within</strong> the respective node sets and the mean shortest distance <strong>between</strong> them.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
S_{AB} = &lt;d_{AB}&gt; - \frac{&lt;d_{AA}&gt; + &lt;d_BB&gt;}{2}.
\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: negative <span class="math inline">\(S_{AB}\)</span> indicates topological overlap of the two node sets, while a positive <span class="math inline">\(S_{AB}\)</span> indicates a topological separation of the two node sets.</p>
<p>The size of the overlap is highly predictive of pathological and functional similarity, elevated co-expression, symptoms similarity, and high comorbidity diseases.</p>

<h2>Gene Co-expression Networks</h2>
<p>In co-expression networks, a pair of nodes is typically connected by a link if the genes they represent show a <em>significantly correlated expression pattern</em> across a set of biological samples of interest. They are often built from genome-wide expression data measured by RNA-Seq or microarrays. Those networks are often weighted, and it represents the strength of a gene-pair relationship. Gene co-expression networks are also signed, and the sign of the link can be indicative of whether a gene pair is regulated in the same direction or oppositely controlled. The majority of the methods used for constructing those networks rely on a similarity measure, such as mutual information or correlation. In this course, we will use the <strong>wTO</strong> <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Gysi2018" role="doc-biblioref">Deisy Morselli Gysi et al. 2018</a>; <a href="#ref-Nowick2009" role="doc-biblioref">Nowick et al. 2009</a>)</span> method . This is a correlation based method, that normalizes the effect of the interaction by all gene neibours and that also accounts for positive and negative interactions. It also calculates the probability for each gene pair, reducing the false positive links.</p>
<p>A next step for co-expression analysis is by comparing the resulting networks for different groups. For that the <strong>CoDiNA</strong> (Co-expression Differential Network Analysis) <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-morselligysi2020" role="doc-biblioref">Morselli Gysi et al. 2020</a>)</span> method can be used.</p>
<div id="construction-of-co-expression-networks" class="section level3">
<h3>Construction of co-expression networks</h3>
<p>To run the weighted topological overlap (wTO) in R we can easily do by loading the wTO R package. It calculates the networks using expression data, where genes are on the rows and individuals in the columns. The user can select parallel computing for faster computation.</p>
<p>For the sake of time, we will be focusing here on the network of differential expressed genes. However, in a real set-up, the best approach is to use the full set of genes.</p>
<p>For the analysis we will be using the data from GSE12654 <span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-Iwamoto2004" role="doc-biblioref">Iwamoto et al. 2004</a>)</span>. The file here contains Pre Frontal Cortex samples from Control and patients with Bipolar Disorder, Schizophrenia and Major Depression, and is already filtered for only differential expressed genes.</p>

<h3>Comparing multiple networks</h3>
<p>When comparing more than one network, different measures can be used, for example, one can identify the hubs in one network, identify modules and clusters in each one and compare those results. However, none of those comparisons compare the network topology and structure. For that, we have to compare links and nodes, and it can be easily done using CoDiNA.</p>
<p>CoDiNA identifies links - and nodes -that are <strong>common</strong> to all networks; <strong>specific</strong> to one network; or <strong>different</strong> in one network.</p>
<ul>
<li>Common (<span class="math inline">\(\alpha\)</span> | <code>a</code>): A particular interaction exists in <em>all networks</em> under comparison <em>with the same sign</em>;</li>
<li>Different (<span class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span> | <code>b.</code>): A particular interaction exists in <em>all networks</em> under comparison <em>with different sign</em>;</li>
<li>Specific (<span class="math inline">\(\gamma\)</span> | <code>g.</code>): A particular interaction <em>does not</em> exists in <em>all networks</em> under comparison.</li>
</ul>
<p>To calculate it, you can use the function <code>MakeDiffNet</code> and you need to provide a edge list with the weights.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>require(CoDiNA)
