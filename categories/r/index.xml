Several software packages exist for generating and analyzing such networks, either from correlation scores or the absolute value of a transformed score called weighted topological overlap (wTO). However, since gene regulatory processes can up- or down-regulate genes, it is of great interest to explicitly consider both positive and negative correlations when constructing a gene co-expression network.</description></item><item><title>Statistics and Data Analysis</title><link>/teaching/evop7/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Mar 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/teaching/evop7/</guid><description>7th Programming for Evolutionary Biology Course The aim of this short course was to give a lecture on basic statistics using R.</description></item><item><title>Ecology</title><link>/projects/ecology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/ecology/</guid><description>Summary Different species interact with one another in differnt manners, according to their surrounding.
