(2007), Furlong (2013), Dempsey et al. (2013)) to the understanding of how factors interact. In such networks, nodes represent genes and a weighted link between a pair of genes is often a correlation, where the sign suggests an up- or down-regulation of one factor by another (Dam et al.</description></item><item><title>wTO: an R package to calculate weighted topological overlap networks</title><link>/talk/hs2016/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talk/hs2016/</guid><description>Presentation about the wTO R package.</description></item><item><title>Evolution of gene co-expression networks implicated in cognitive functions in primates</title><link>/talk/hs2015/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talk/hs2015/</guid><description>Presentation about the evolution of gene co-expression networks and how it implicated in cognitive functions in primates.</description></item></channel></rss>
