Network Science: Overview Network Science is broadly employed in many fields: from understanding how friends bond in a party to how animals interact; from how superheroes appear in the same comic books to how genes can be related to a specific biological process. Network analysis is especially beneficial for understanding complex systems, in all research fields.</description></item><item><title>Network Analysis for biological systems</title><link>/teaching/2ndwab/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/teaching/2ndwab/</guid><description> 2nd Workshop of Advanced Bioinformatics: Network Medicine</description></item><item><title>NetSci</title><link>/rpackages/netsci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rpackages/netsci/</guid><description> In construction</description></item><item><title>Whole transcriptomic network analysis using Co-expression Differential Network Analysis (CoDiNA)</title><link>/publications/codina/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/codina/</guid><description>Abstract Biological and medical sciences are increasingly acknowledging the significance of gene co-expression-networks for investigating complex-systems, phenotypes or diseases. Typically, complex phenotypes are investigated under varying conditions. While approaches for comparing nodes and links in two networks exist, almost no methods for the comparison of multiple networks are available and—to best of our knowledge—no comparative method allows for whole transcriptomic network analysis. However, it is the aim of many studies to compare networks of different conditions, for example, tissues, diseases, treatments, time points, or species.</description></item><item><title>CoDiNA</title><link>/rpackages/codina/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rpackages/codina/</guid><description>The usage of the Co-expression Differential Network analysis has been growing by the Biological and Medical science for the analysis of complex systems or diseases. We have developed a method that is able to compare as many networks as desired, by caracterizing both links and nodes that are common, different or specific to each network.
