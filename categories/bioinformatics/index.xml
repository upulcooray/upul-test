Recently, a third lineage, referred to as the “Adriatic” was described within the L. viridis complex distributed from Slovenia to Greece. However, whether gene flow between the Adriatic lineage and L. viridis or L.</description></item><item><title>Network medicine framework for identifying drug-repurposing opportunities for COVID-19</title><link>/publications/covid_drugs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 11 May 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/covid_drugs/</guid><description>Abstract The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the importance of prioritizing approved drugs to treat severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infections. Here, we deployed algorithms relying on artificial intelligence, network diffusion, and network proximity to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. We experimentally screened 918 drugs, allowing us to evaluate the performance of the existing drug-repurposing methodologies, and used a consensus algorithm to increase the accuracy of the predictions.</description></item><item><title>A wealth of discovery built on the Human Genome Project — by the numbers</title><link>/publications/humangenome/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/humangenome/</guid><description>Abstract A new analysis traces the story of the draft genome’s impact on genomics since 2001, linking its effects on publications, drug approvals and understanding of disease.

Yet, in most studies only a small subset of the top candidates is validated experimentally, hence the true predictive power of the existing repurposing algorithms remains unknown. To quantify and compare their true predictive power, different algorithms must make predictions for the same set of candidates, and the experimental validation must focus not only on the top candidates, as it does now, but on a wider list of drugs chosen independently of their predicted rank.</description></item><item><title>Seasonal dynamics of pelagic mycoplanktonic communities: interplay of taxon abundance, temporal occurrence, and biotic interactions</title><link>/publications/fungi/</link><pubDate>Wed, 10 Jun 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/fungi/</guid><description>Abstract Marine fungi are an important component of pelagic planktonic communities. However, it is not yet clear how individual fungal taxa are integrated in marine processes of the microbial loop and food webs. Most likely, biotic interactions play a major role in shaping the fungal community structure. Thus, the aim of our work was to identify possible biotic interactions of mycoplankton with phytoplankton and zooplankton groups and among fungi, and to investigate whether there is coherence between interactions and the dynamics, abundance and temporal occurrence of individual fungal OTUs.</description></item><item><title>Construction, comparison and evolution of networks in life sciences and other disciplines</title><link>/publications/review_networks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/review_networks/</guid><description>Abstract Network approaches have become pervasive in many research fields. They allow for a more comprehensive understanding of complex relationships between entities as well as their group-level properties and dynamics. Many networks change over time, be it within seconds or millions of years, depending on the nature of the network. Our focus will be on comparative network analyses in life sciences, where deciphering temporal network changes is a core interest of molecular, ecological, neuropsychological and evolutionary biologists.</description></item><item><title>Mental Wealth</title><link>/projects/mentalwealth/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/mentalwealth/</guid><description>Summary Cognition is a group of mental processes that include attention, memory, producing and understanding of language, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision making. Basically, cognition is what sets us - humans, assuming you are one of us - apart from other animals.
When cognition is affected, our mental health is affected and can lead to more complex disorders such as Bipolar Disorder, Major Depression, PTSD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Schizophrenia, etc.</description></item><item><title>Combined Experimental and System-Level Analyses Reveal the Complex Regulatory Network of miR-124 during Human Neurogenesis</title><link>/publications/mirna124/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/mirna124/</guid><description>Abstract Non-coding RNAs regulate many biological processes including neurogenesis. The brain-enriched miR-124 has been assigned as a key player of neuronal differentiation via its complex but little understood regulation of thousands of annotated targets. To systematically chart its regulatory functions, we used CRISPR/ Cas9 gene editing to disrupt all six miR-124 alleles in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Upon neuronal induction, miR-124-deleted cells underwent neurogenesis and became functional neurons, albeit with altered morphology and neurotransmitter specification.</description></item><item><title>Gene Co-expression Networks</title><link>/projects/coexpress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/coexpress/</guid><description>Summary In co-expression networks, a pair of nodes is typically connected by a link if the genes they represent show a significantly correlated expression pattern across a set of biological samples of interest. They are often built from genome-wide expression data measured by RNA-Seq or microarrays. Those networks are often weighted, and it represents the strength of a gene-pair relationship. Gene co-expression networks are also signed, and the sign of the link can be indicative of whether a gene pair is regulated in the same direction or oppositely controlled.</description></item><item><title>Measuring hand hygiene compliance rates at hospital entrances</title><link>/publications/hands/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/hands/</guid><description>Abstract Despite the importance of hand hygiene in the health care setting, there are no studies evaluating hand hygiene compliance at hospital entrances. The study was prospectively performed over a 33-week period from March 30, 2014-November 15, 2014, to evaluate hand hygiene compliance in 2 hospital reception areas. We compared electronic handwash counters with the application of radiofrequency identification (GOJO SMARTLINK) (electronic observer) that counts each activation of alcohol gel dispensers to direct observation (human observer) via remote review of video surveillance.</description></item></channel></rss>
