Typically, complex phenotypes are investigated under varying conditions. While approaches for comparing nodes and links in two networks exist, almost no methods for the comparison of multiple networks are available and—to best of our knowledge—no comparative method allows for whole transcriptomic network analysis. However, it is the aim of many studies to compare networks of different conditions, for example, tissues, diseases, treatments, time points, or species.</description></item><item><title>wTO: an R package for computing weighted topological overlap and a consensus network with integrated visualization tool</title><link>/publications/wto/</link><pubDate>Wed, 24 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/wto/</guid><description>Abstract Network analyses, such as of gene co-expression networks, metabolic networks and ecological networks have become a central approach for the systems-level study of biological data. Several software packages exist for generating and analyzing such networks, either from correlation scores or the absolute value of a transformed score called weighted topological overlap (wTO). However, since gene regulatory processes can up- or down-regulate genes, it is of great interest to explicitly consider both positive and negative correlations when constructing a gene co-expression network.</description></item></channel></rss>
