However, it is not yet clear how individual fungal taxa are integrated in marine processes of the microbial loop and food webs. Most likely, biotic interactions play a major role in shaping the fungal community structure. Thus, the aim of our work was to identify possible biotic interactions of mycoplankton with phytoplankton and zooplankton groups and among fungi, and to investigate whether there is coherence between interactions and the dynamics, abundance and temporal occurrence of individual fungal OTUs.</description></item><item><title>Honey bee virus causes context-dependent changes in host social behavior</title><link>/publications/bees/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Apr 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/bees/</guid><description>Abstract Anthropogenic changes create evolutionarily novel environments that present opportunities for emerging diseases, potentially changing the balance between host and pathogen. Honey bees provide essential pollination services, but intensification and globalization of honey bee management has coincided with increased pathogen pressure, primarily due to a parasitic mite/virus complex. Here, we investigated how honey bee individual and group phenotypes are altered by a virus of concern, Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV).</description></item><item><title>Ecology</title><link>/projects/ecology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/ecology/</guid><description>Summary Different species interact with one another in differnt manners, according to their surrounding. The project related to ecology I&amp;rsquo;m involved with focus on the identification of community structures based on metagenomics.
