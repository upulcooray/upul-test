Several software packages exist for generating and analyzing such networks, either from correlation scores or the absolute value of a transformed score called weighted topological overlap (wTO). However, since gene regulatory processes can up- or down-regulate genes, it is of great interest to explicitly consider both positive and negative correlations when constructing a gene co-expression network.</description></item></channel></rss>
