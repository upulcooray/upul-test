Network Science: Overview Network Science is broadly employed in many fields: from understanding how friends bond in a party to how animals interact; from how superheroes appear in the same comic books to how genes can be related to a specific biological process. Network analysis is especially beneficial for understanding complex systems, in all research fields.</description></item><item><title>Network Analysis for biological systems</title><link>/teaching/2ndwab/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/teaching/2ndwab/</guid><description> 2nd Workshop of Advanced Bioinformatics: Network Medicine</description></item><item><title>NetSci</title><link>/rpackages/netsci/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rpackages/netsci/</guid><description> In construction</description></item><item><title>Drug Repurpusing</title><link>/projects/drugrepurpusing/</link><pubDate>Fri, 01 Jan 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/drugrepurpusing/</guid><description>Summary Drug repurposing algorithms rank drugs based on one or multiple streams of information, such as molecular profiles, chemical structures, adverse profiles, molecular docking, electronic health records, pathway analysis, genome wide association studies (GWAS), and network perturbations. Yet, in most studies only a small subset of the top candidates is validated experimentally, hence the true predictive power of the existing repurposing algorithms remains unknown. To quantify and compare their true predictive power, different algorithms must make predictions for the same set of candidates, and the experimental validation must focus not only on the top candidates, as it does now, but on a wider list of drugs chosen independently of their predicted rank.</description></item><item><title>CoDiNA</title><link>/rpackages/codina/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rpackages/codina/</guid><description>The usage of the Co-expression Differential Network analysis has been growing by the Biological and Medical science for the analysis of complex systems or diseases. We have developed a method that is able to compare as many networks as desired, by caracterizing both links and nodes that are common, different or specific to each network.

Basically, cognition is what sets us - humans, assuming you are one of us - apart from other animals.
When cognition is affected, our mental health is affected and can lead to more complex disorders such as Bipolar Disorder, Major Depression, PTSD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Schizophrenia, etc.</description></item><item><title>RichR</title><link>/rpackages/richr/</link><pubDate>Wed, 13 Feb 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rpackages/richr/</guid><description>It provides a list of genes associated to diseases (g2d$clean and g2d$complete) based on the following 4 publications (GS2D, Fontaine (2016) [doi:10.18547/gcb.2016.vol2.iss1.e33], DisGeNET, Pinero (2016) [doi:10.1093/nar/gkw943] Berto2016, Berto (2016) [doi:10.3389/fgene.2016.00031] and PsyGeNET, Sacristan (2015) [doi:10.1093/bioinformatics/btv301]). Those lists were combined and manually curated to have matching disease names. When provided a list of gene names, it calculates the disease enrichment of the gene set. The enrichment is calculated using proportion test and Fisher’s exact test.</description></item><item><title>wTO</title><link>/rpackages/wto/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rpackages/wto/</guid><description>wTO: Computing Weighted Topological Overlaps (wTO) &amp;amp; Consensus wTO Network Computes the Weighted Topological Overlap with positive and negative signs (wTO) networks (Nowick et al. (2009) doi:10.1073/pnas.0911376106) given a data frame containing the mRNA count/ expression/ abundance per sample, and a vector containing the interested nodes of interaction (a subset of the elements of the full data frame).

They are often built from genome-wide expression data measured by RNA-Seq or microarrays. Those networks are often weighted, and it represents the strength of a gene-pair relationship. Gene co-expression networks are also signed, and the sign of the link can be indicative of whether a gene pair is regulated in the same direction or oppositely controlled.</description></item></channel></rss>
