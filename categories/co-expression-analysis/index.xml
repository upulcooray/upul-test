Recently, a third lineage, referred to as the “Adriatic” was described within the L. viridis complex distributed from Slovenia to Greece. However, whether gene flow between the Adriatic lineage and L. viridis or L.</description></item><item><title>Co-expression differential network analysis: CoDiNA</title><link>/talk/ibc2018/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talk/ibc2018/</guid><description>XXIX International Biometric Conference Background Biological networks can be represented and analyzed using systems biology; Gene co-expression networks have been particularly helpful (Barabasi and Oltvai (2004), Bansal et al. (2007), Furlong (2013), Dempsey et al. (2013)) to the understanding of how factors interact. In such networks, nodes represent genes and a weighted link between a pair of genes is often a correlation, where the sign suggests an up- or down-regulation of one factor by another (Dam et al.</description></item></channel></rss>
