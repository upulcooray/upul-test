We have developed a method that is able to compare as many networks as desired, by caracterizing both links and nodes that are common, different or specific to each network.

Those lists were combined and manually curated to have matching disease names. When provided a list of gene names, it calculates the disease enrichment of the gene set. The enrichment is calculated using proportion test and Fisher’s exact test.</description></item><item><title>wTO</title><link>/rpackages/wto/</link><pubDate>Sat, 17 Nov 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rpackages/wto/</guid><description>wTO: Computing Weighted Topological Overlaps (wTO) &amp;amp; Consensus wTO Network Computes the Weighted Topological Overlap with positive and negative signs (wTO) networks (Nowick et al. (2009) doi:10.1073/pnas.0911376106) given a data frame containing the mRNA count/ expression/ abundance per sample, and a vector containing the interested nodes of interaction (a subset of the elements of the full data frame).
