Yet, in most studies only a small subset of the top candidates is validated experimentally, hence the true predictive power of the existing repurposing algorithms remains unknown. To quantify and compare their true predictive power, different algorithms must make predictions for the same set of candidates, and the experimental validation must focus not only on the top candidates, as it does now, but on a wider list of drugs chosen independently of their predicted rank.</description></item><item><title>Mental Wealth</title><link>/projects/mentalwealth/</link><pubDate>Wed, 01 Jan 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/mentalwealth/</guid><description>Summary Cognition is a group of mental processes that include attention, memory, producing and understanding of language, learning, reasoning, problem-solving, and decision making. Basically, cognition is what sets us - humans, assuming you are one of us - apart from other animals.
When cognition is affected, our mental health is affected and can lead to more complex disorders such as Bipolar Disorder, Major Depression, PTSD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Schizophrenia, etc.</description></item><item><title>Ecology</title><link>/projects/ecology/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/ecology/</guid><description>Summary Different species interact with one another in differnt manners, according to their surrounding. The project related to ecology I&amp;rsquo;m involved with focus on the identification of community structures based on metagenomics.

They are often built from genome-wide expression data measured by RNA-Seq or microarrays. Those networks are often weighted, and it represents the strength of a gene-pair relationship. Gene co-expression networks are also signed, and the sign of the link can be indicative of whether a gene pair is regulated in the same direction or oppositely controlled.</description></item></channel></rss>
