Basically, cognition is what sets us - humans, assuming you are one of us - apart from other animals.
When cognition is affected, our mental health is affected and can lead to more complex disorders such as Bipolar Disorder, Major Depression, PTSD, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Schizophrenia, etc.</description></item><item><title>Gene Co-expression Networks</title><link>/projects/coexpress/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/projects/coexpress/</guid><description>Summary In co-expression networks, a pair of nodes is typically connected by a link if the genes they represent show a significantly correlated expression pattern across a set of biological samples of interest. They are often built from genome-wide expression data measured by RNA-Seq or microarrays. Those networks are often weighted, and it represents the strength of a gene-pair relationship. Gene co-expression networks are also signed, and the sign of the link can be indicative of whether a gene pair is regulated in the same direction or oppositely controlled.</description></item></channel></rss>
