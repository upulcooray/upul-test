Yet, in most studies only a small subset of the top candidates is validated experimentally, hence the true predictive power of the existing repurposing algorithms remains unknown. To quantify and compare their true predictive power, different algorithms must make predictions for the same set of candidates, and the experimental validation must focus not only on the top candidates, as it does now, but on a wider list of drugs chosen independently of their predicted rank.</description></item></channel></rss>
