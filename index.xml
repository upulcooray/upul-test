Network Science: Overview Network Science is broadly employed in many fields: from understanding how friends bond in a party to how animals interact; from how superheroes appear in the same comic books to how genes can be related to a specific biological process. Network analysis is especially beneficial for understanding complex systems, in all research fields.</description></item><item><title>A wealth of discovery built on the Human Genome Project — by the numbers</title><link>/publications/humangenome/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Feb 2021 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/humangenome/</guid><description>Abstract A new analysis traces the story of the draft genome’s impact on genomics since 2001, linking its effects on publications, drug approvals and understanding of disease.

Yet, in most studies only a small subset of the top candidates is validated experimentally, hence the true predictive power of the existing repurposing algorithms remains unknown. To quantify and compare their true predictive power, different algorithms must make predictions for the same set of candidates, and the experimental validation must focus not only on the top candidates, as it does now, but on a wider list of drugs chosen independently of their predicted rank.</description></item><item><title>Network Medicine approaches for the study of SARS-CoV2 and drug repurposing</title><link>/talk/sigdrug/</link><pubDate>Thu, 03 Dec 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talk/sigdrug/</guid><description>Presentation about drug repurpusing methodologies in the context of COVID-19 at SIG-Drug Design</description></item><item><title>Network Medicine Framework for Identifying Drug Repurposing Opportunities for COVID-19</title><link>/talk/alert/</link><pubDate>Thu, 22 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talk/alert/</guid><description>Presentation about drug repurpusing methodologies in the context of COVID-19 at ALERT-NEU</description></item><item><title>Whole transcriptomic network analysis using Co-expression Differential Network Analysis (CoDiNA)</title><link>/publications/codina/</link><pubDate>Thu, 15 Oct 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/codina/</guid><description>Abstract Biological and medical sciences are increasingly acknowledging the significance of gene co-expression-networks for investigating complex-systems, phenotypes or diseases. Typically, complex phenotypes are investigated under varying conditions. While approaches for comparing nodes and links in two networks exist, almost no methods for the comparison of multiple networks are available and—to best of our knowledge—no comparative method allows for whole transcriptomic network analysis. However, it is the aim of many studies to compare networks of different conditions, for example, tissues, diseases, treatments, time points, or species.</description></item><item><title>CoDiNA</title><link>/rpackages/codina/</link><pubDate>Wed, 15 Jul 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/rpackages/codina/</guid><description>The usage of the Co-expression Differential Network analysis has been growing by the Biological and Medical science for the analysis of complex systems or diseases.

However, it is not yet clear how individual fungal taxa are integrated in marine processes of the microbial loop and food webs. Most likely, biotic interactions play a major role in shaping the fungal community structure. Thus, the aim of our work was to identify possible biotic interactions of mycoplankton with phytoplankton and zooplankton groups and among fungi, and to investigate whether there is coherence between interactions and the dynamics, abundance and temporal occurrence of individual fungal OTUs.</description></item><item><title>Network Medicine Framework for Identifying Drug Repurposing Opportunities for COVID-19</title><link>/talk/pubboston/</link><pubDate>Fri, 29 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talk/pubboston/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Construction, comparison and evolution of networks in life sciences and other disciplines</title><link>/publications/review_networks/</link><pubDate>Wed, 06 May 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/review_networks/</guid><description>Abstract Network approaches have become pervasive in many research fields.

Honey bees provide essential pollination services, but intensification and globalization of honey bee management has coincided with increased pathogen pressure, primarily due to a parasitic mite/virus complex.

Several software packages exist for generating and analyzing such networks, either from correlation scores or the absolute value of a transformed score called weighted topological overlap (wTO). However, since gene regulatory processes can up- or down-regulate genes, it is of great interest to explicitly consider both positive and negative correlations when constructing a gene co-expression network.</description></item><item><title>Combined Experimental and System-Level Analyses Reveal the Complex Regulatory Network of miR-124 during Human Neurogenesis</title><link>/publications/mirna124/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/mirna124/</guid><description>Abstract Non-coding RNAs regulate many biological processes including neurogenesis. The brain-enriched miR-124 has been assigned as a key player of neuronal differentiation via its complex but little understood regulation of thousands of annotated targets. To systematically chart its regulatory functions, we used CRISPR/ Cas9 gene editing to disrupt all six miR-124 alleles in human induced pluripotent stem cells. Upon neuronal induction, miR-124-deleted cells underwent neurogenesis and became functional neurons, albeit with altered morphology and neurotransmitter specification.</description></item><item><title>Co-expression differential network analysis</title><link>/talk/advancednetsci/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talk/advancednetsci/</guid><description/></item><item><title>Co-expression differential network analysis: CoDiNA</title><link>/talk/ibc2018/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 May 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talk/ibc2018/</guid><description>XXIX International Biometric Conference Background Biological networks can be represented and analyzed using systems biology; Gene co-expression networks have been particularly helpful (Barabasi and Oltvai (2004), Bansal et al.

They are often built from genome-wide expression data measured by RNA-Seq or microarrays. Those networks are often weighted, and it represents the strength of a gene-pair relationship. Gene co-expression networks are also signed, and the sign of the link can be indicative of whether a gene pair is regulated in the same direction or oppositely controlled.</description></item><item><title>Statistics and Data Analysis</title><link>/teaching/evop6/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Mar 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/teaching/evop6/</guid><description>6th Programming for Evolutionary Biology Course The aim of this short course was to give a lecture on basic statistics using R.</description></item><item><title>wTO: an R package to calculate weighted topological overlap networks</title><link>/talk/hs2016/</link><pubDate>Mon, 10 Oct 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talk/hs2016/</guid><description>Presentation about the wTO R package.</description></item><item><title>Evolution of gene co-expression networks implicated in cognitive functions in primates</title><link>/talk/hs2015/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/talk/hs2015/</guid><description>Presentation about the evolution of gene co-expression networks and how it implicated in cognitive functions in primates.</description></item><item><title>Measuring hand hygiene compliance rates at hospital entrances</title><link>/publications/hands/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Oct 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>/publications/hands/</guid><description>Abstract Despite the importance of hand hygiene in the health care setting, there are no studies evaluating hand hygiene compliance at hospital entrances.
